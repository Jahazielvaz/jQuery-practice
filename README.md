# JQUERY PRACTICE

## Description:
  * The purpose of this exercise is for us to learn the basics of jQuery, so we can use it with ease.

## Symbols
  * $: This is how you access jQuery
  * ("p"): This is how you select an html element
  * (selector).action() : The action part I believe is how you perform js. For example: ('div').hide() : This will hide the div tags.

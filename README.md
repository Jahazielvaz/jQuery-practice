# JQUERY PRACTICE

## Description:
  * The purpose of this exercise is for us to learn the basics of jQuery, so we can use it with ease.

## Symbols
  * $: This is how you access jQuery
  * ("p"): This is how you select an html element
  * (selector).action() : The action part I believe is how you perform js. For example: ('div').hide() : This will hide the div tags. (this).hide() : Hides the current element that's being targeter

  * $(document).ready(() => {
      [jQuery codeblock goes here]
    })
    The purpose of the document.ready, is to make sure that jQuery doesn't run until the document or the html code runs is fully loaded, so that jQuery can take over

  * Shorthand for document.ready:
    $(() => {

      })
  NOTE: jQuery selectors are among the most important aspects of jQuery. This is how you select html elements based on CSS selectors. jQuery also has it's own custom selectors. All selectors are triggered with $()
